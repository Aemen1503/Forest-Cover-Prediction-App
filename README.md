# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction App

This project is a **Machine Learning + Streamlit web application** that predicts forest cover types based on various geographical features such as elevation, soil type, aspect, and slope.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This app uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the Forest Cover Type dataset to predict the type of forest based on input terrain features. It was built as part of a machine learning internship project.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **scikit-learn**
- Trained using **Random Forest Classifier**
- EDA performed (boxplot, pairplot, heatmap)
- Interactive web interface for prediction
- Model trained on 15120 samples, 54 features
